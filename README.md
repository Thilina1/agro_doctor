Agriculture plays a significant role in the Sri Lankan economy in values of employment and production. In the last few years contribution has declined, Because of plant diseases, and insufficient knowledge. Lankan farmers' production decisions are mostly based on insufficient knowledge about the outcome of the decision. Therefore, most planters are facing trouble with decision-making. They face these problems because of not using adequate data to make decisions. Another main problem is plant diseases. Owing to plant diseases Sri Lanka loses 35% of crop production annually. Because of these problems, the Sri Lankan agriculture industry operates at a lower production capacity. Using high-level technologies can solve most of these problems. The objective of this study is to address problems and propose solutions to challenges using modern technologies with affordable, easy, and provide accessibility to all farming communities. According to searches, plant disease detection is challenging due to expert knowledge and improper laboratory facilities. This mobile application addresses this problem with Machine learning and image processing techniques. Algorithms trained using a dataset of images of plants. Then the algorithms will be able to identify diseased plants These plant leaf disease detection methods can be beneficial for traditional farmers and decrease the laborious work of monitoring crop farms and for early or easily recognizing disease symptoms. And can suggest solutions for treating crop diseases. Mobile application sends alerts when plant disease spreads in nearby areas. This application provides daily weather reports, a Fertilizer calculator, a Calendar for planning the whole process during the cultivation, cultivation tips, daily agriculture news, daily prices of vegetables, and also there is an option to keep special notes in the app. These services provide data and help farmers to make decisions and suggest solutions to the farmers to manage cultivation, help to save time and increase income and efficiency. Apart from these services, this application introduces a platform for farmers and gardeners to communicate with experts and other farmers and gardeners through an agricultural forum. Machine learning, cloud computing, mobile technologies, and image processing techniques are used to develop this system.
